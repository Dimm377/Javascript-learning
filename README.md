## JavaScript Learning Documentation & Summary

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries while learning JavaScript and I have finally established a learning method that suits my style
if you want to run the code (using node.js)
```
node Objects.js or etc
```
### Including
- Variables
- Arrays
- Functions
- Objects
- Operator
- Loop (ForLoops, WhileLoops, Do-whileLoops)

### Objective
Understand basic JavaScript concepts through hands-on practice and simple examples

#### Install your runtime (all three have their own advantages)
