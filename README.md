This repository contains my personal notes and summaries while learning JavaScript and I have finally established a learning method that suits my style
if you want to run the code 
'''
node Objects.js or etc
'''
### Including
- Variables
- Arrays
- Functions

#### Install your runtime (all three have their own advantages)
